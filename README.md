# Numerical methods for Physics and Astronomy

This class will use the Julia programming language as well as Python's matplotlib library for visualizations.

## Prerequisites

## Julia and Atom setup

Install the latest Julia from https://julialang.org/downloads/

Install the Atom editor https://atom.io/.

Install the language-julia Atom package from within the Settings/Preferences of Atom, Install tab: this enables syntax highlighting of Julia code.

Install the latex-completions Atom package from within Atom: this enables the autocompletion of LaTeX symbols (α, β, ...)

### PyPlot setup for Windows and Linux

Under Windows and Linux, launch Julia, press ```]``` to trigger the package manager then type ```add PyPlot```.

### PyPlot setup for OSX
Installing the PyPlot julia plotting library on OSX can be a bit tricky.
All the details are here if you need: https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyPlot.jl but here is a summary:

Mac users will need to have XQuartz installed first.
Then there are three possible paths:

Path 1: you've already got your own python installation and want to use it for this course, go to julia and type ```ENV["PYTHON"]="/pathto/python"``` where ```pathto``` is your actual path (check with ```which python``` from terminal).


Path 2: you don't have a python installation  and just want the default Julia on, go to Julia and type ```ENV["PYTHON"]=""```

Path 3: you want to install your own python from scratch, using HomeBrew https://brew.sh/. This is the most complicated way, and slow, but a surer way to have it work.
```
brew install python gcc freetype pyqt
brew link --force freetype
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
export PYTHONPATH="/usr/local/lib/python2.7:$PYTHONPATH"
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
```
Then edit your ~/.profile to add the two export lines.
Then go to Julia and type ```ENV["PYTHON"]="/usr/local/bin/python"```.
After any of these paths, go to the package manager ```]``` and type ```add PyCall```, then ```add PyPlot```.

### OSX backend selection

There are multiple backends (GUI frameworks) that can be used to display the plotting windows drawn by PyPlot.
The default may not work for you, and may even trigger your lock screen by crashing the desktop manager.
In this case, you can try to force the backend *before* loading PyPlot.
```
ENV["MPLBACKEND"]="qt5agg"
using PyPlot
plot(rand(100))
```
Possible backends are ```qt5agg```, ```tkagg```.

To permanently store the best backend create a file called ```~/.config/matplotlibrc``` with one line ```backend: Qt5Agg``` or ```backend: TkAgg```.



#
## Check that you can use the REPL

1. Launch julia from the command line.

2. Check that it can do basic operations, e.g. input ```2+2``` then press enter.

3. Check that it can plot basic functions using the PyPlot library.

```julia
using PyPlot
x=range(-pi, pi, length=100)
plot(x,sin.(x))
grid()
```
